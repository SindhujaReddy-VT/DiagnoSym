# BACK_END:

1. Api for login and register is available in app.js file.
2. And the schema for database is available as a part of userDetails.js file
3. Final file names will be subjected to name changes and this is just an initialisation for the project.

Steps to get started:
1. Create a mongo account and provide all email id's here so that the access could be granted to everyone for the database acess. (`https://www.mongodb.com/`)
2. In order to run this backend folder, navigate into back-end folder and give the command `nodemon app` which starts the server and database.
